- [x] 3. Functions
- [x] 4. Arrays and pointers

- [x] 8. structs, unions

## Latest session
Pass count: 262/262 before, 272/272 after (86 of 86 compiler_tests, 186 of 186 custom). No test that passed before now fails.
Fixed: cleanup session (reviewer approved 2026-11-10): a name is in scope in its own initialiser, null pointer constants and `void *` in `?:`, and `short` / `unsigned short`, with signed 2-byte struct fields and full-word outgoing stack arguments. 10 new custom tests.
Blocked: no new blockers. Non-blocking items are in BLOCKERS "Nice to have from the cleanup review". Marcus accepted D19 on 2026-11-10.
Remaining failures: none.
Next: nothing planned. All 8 features and the cleanup are done; the open items are in docs/BLOCKERS.md.
